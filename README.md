# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Twitter Clone

This is the sample application which is a twitter clone, from the
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

It is currently under development and hence does not fully emulate twitter functuinality. At this point, there is no support for user 'tweets', however it will be shortly implemented.

* Ruby version: 2.0.0

* Rails version: 4.0.0
